<h2>
What cookies are and how they are used
</h2>

As part of offering and providing customizable and personalized services, pashutlehaskir.com
may use cookies to store and sometimes track information about you. A cookie is a small amount
of data that is sent to your browser from a web server and stored on your computer’s hard drive.
Several features of the pashutlehaskir.com require that you accept cookies in order to work
properly. (See "what choices are available to you regarding collection, use, and distribution of
your information" for more information on cookies.)
<br/>
Generally, we use cookies for the following purposes:
<br/>

To identify and label all "new" vacancies since your last visit to the site.
<br/>
Optionally to permanently save your password on your computer so you don't have to re-
enter it each time you visit our site.
<br/>
To enable you to "checklist and compare" vacancies that you want to mark for future
retrieval and viewing.
<br/>
Advertising networks that advertise on pashutlehaskir.com may also use their own cookies.
<br/>
pashutlehaskir.com may also collect IP addresses for system administration, fraud prevention,
and to report aggregate information to our advertisers.
<br/>

<h2>
How your information is used
</h2>

The primary goal of pashutlehaskir.com in collecting personal information is to provide
you, the user, with a customized experience and to assist your navigation throughout
pashutlehaskir.com.
<br/>

<h2>
Who is collecting your information?
</h2>

When you are asked for personal information on pashutlehaskir.com, you are sharing that
information with pashutlehaskir.com alone, unless it is specifically stated otherwise. However,
some activities will, by their very nature, result in your personal information being revealed to
other users of the pashutlehaskir.com. For example, when you enter personal information on
the vacancy posting form, this information will generally be included in your vacancy, unless
specifically stated otherwise. Also, if you request to be contacted by one of our advertising
partners, some of your contact information may be shared.
<br/>

<h2>With whom your information may be shared</h2>

As a general rule, pashutlehaskir.com will not disclose any of your personally identifiable
information except when we have your permission or under special circumstances, such as when
we believe in good faith that the law requires it or under the circumstances described below.
Please see the “Terms of Service” or “Use Agreements” for each of our products and services for
more detailed information about how your personal information may be shared.
<br/>
pashutlehaskir.com may disclose account information in special cases when we have reason
to believe that disclosing this information is necessary to identify, contact or bring legal action
against someone who may be violating the “Terms of Service” of the pashutlehaskir.com or
may be causing injury to or interference with (either intentionally or unintentionally) the rights
or property of pashutlehaskir.com, other users of the pashutlehaskir.com, or anyone else
that could be harmed by such activities. pashutlehaskir.com may disclose or access account
information when we believe in good faith that the law requires it and for administrative and
other purposes that we deem necessary to maintain, service, and improve our products and
services.
<br/>

<h2>
What choices are available to you regarding collection, use and distribution of
your information?
</h2>
You also have choices with respect to cookies. By modifying your browser preferences,
you have the choice to accept all cookies, to be notified when a cookie is set, or to reject
all cookies. If you choose to reject all cookies you will be unable to use those services and
features of pashutlehaskir.com that require registration in order to participate. These services
include the identification of new vacancies that have been posted since your last visit, auto-
filling of the logon form, and the Favorites feature. You can still use most of the features of
pashutlehaskir.com even if you do not accept cookies.
<br/>

<H2>
What else you should know about your online privacy
</h2>
Please keep in mind that whenever you voluntarily disclose personal information online - for
example in vacancies that you post or through email - that information can be collected and used
by others. In short, if you post personal information online that is accessible to the public, you
may receive unsolicited messages from other parties in return.
<br/>
Ultimately, you are solely responsible for maintaining the secrecy of your passwords and/or any
account information. Please be careful and responsible whenever you are online.
<br/>
Please note that when you communicate with landlords the email of both the landlord
and the customer will be revealed only to each other. It will not be revealed to any other
sources. By registering with our website you agree to this term.
